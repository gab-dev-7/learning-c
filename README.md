# Learning C

This repository is a collection of C programs I wrote while learning the language and now decided to make it public. It serves as both a personal record of my progress and a resource for others who are looking to get started with C programming.

## Credits

Most of the content in this repository follows the excellent YouTube tutorial series by **Dr. Jonas Birch**.

- **YouTube Playlist:** [C Programming Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzMaNVSqfYw)

I have followed along with his lessons and made minor modifications to the code to better suit my learning process.

## Repository Structure

The projects are organized by difficulty level:

### [0-basics/](./0-basics/)

The fundamentals of C programming.

- Hello World
- User Input
- Working with Integers and Floats
- Basic Error Handling

### [1-easy/](./1-easy/)

Introduction to control flow and basic logic.

- `if` and `else` statements
- `while` loops
- Simple geometry with functions

### [2-medium/](./2-medium/)

Slightly more complex concepts involving system functions.

- Random number generation
- Using `sleep`
- Countdown timers
- Dice simulations

### [3-hard/](./3-hard/)

Advanced C topics and memory management.

- Structs
- `switch` statements
- Pointers and References
- `for` loops
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`)

## How to use this repo

You can compile any of the `.c` files using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc folder_name/file_name.c -o folder_name/output_name
./folder_name/bin/output_name
```

Happy coding!
